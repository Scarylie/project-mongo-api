# Project Mongo API

First project to store information in a database using MongoDB. In this project I have stored and retrieved data from the database and used that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

"Routes created:
"/songs": "Get the whole array of songs", one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).
"/songs/id/:id": "Filter by id", one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
"/songs?artist=:artist&danceability=:danceability&genre=:genre": "Filter by artist, danceability or genre", queary parameters to filter the data.

Mongoose models to model data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
